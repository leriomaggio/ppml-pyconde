We want to avoid modifying vectors that already have $L2$ norm below $b$; in that case, we just return the original vector.

Since our differentially private algorithm adds noise to the gradient, this can also affect accuracy - the noise can cause our algorithm to move in *the wrong direction* during training, and actually make the model *worse*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's reasonable to expect that smaller values of $\\epsilon$ will result in less accurate models (since this has been the trend in every differentially private algorithm we have seen so far). This is true, but there's also a slightly more subtle tradeoff which occurs because of the composition we need to consider when we perform many iterations of the algorithm: more iterations means a larger privacy cost. In the standard gradient descent algorithm, more iterations generally result in a better model. In our differentially private version, more iterations can make the model *worse*, since we have to use a smaller $\\epsilon$ for each iteration, and so the scale of the noise goes up. In differentially private machine learning, it's important (and sometimes, very challenging) to strike the right balance between the number of iterations used and the scale of the noise added.\n",

    "Let's do a small experiment to see how the setting of $\\epsilon$ effects the accuracy of our model. We'll train a model for several values of $\\epsilon$, using 20 iterations each time, and graph the accuracy of each model against the $\\epsilon$ value used in training it."
