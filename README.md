# PPML: Machine Learning on Data you cannot see

Repository for the [tutorial](https://2024.pycon.it/en/submission/ryez) on **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** (`PPML`) presented at [PyCon Italia 2024](https://2024.pycon.it)

## Intro

Privacy guarantees are **the** most crucial requirement when it comes to analyse sensitive data. These requirements could be sometimes very stringent, so that it becomes a real barrier for the entire pipeline. Reasons for this are manifold, and involve the fact that data could not be _shared_ nor moved from their silos of resident, let alone analysed in their _raw_ form. As a result, _data anonymisation techniques_ are sometimes used to generate a sanitised version of the original data. However, these techniques alone are not enough to guarantee that privacy will be completely preserved. Moreover, the _memoisation_ effect of Deep learning  models could be maliciously exploited to _attack_ the models, and _reconstruct_  sensitive information about samples used in training, even if these information were not originally provided. 

*Privacy-preserving machine learning* (PPML) methods hold the promise to overcome all those issues, allowing to train machine learning models with full privacy guarantees.

This workshop will be mainly organised in **three** main parts. In the first part, we will introduce the main threats to 
data and machine learning models (e.g. _membership inference attack_ ) for privacy. 
In the second part, we will work our way towards  **differential privacy**: what is it, and how this method works, and 
how differential privacy could be used with Machine learning. 
Lastly, we will conclude the tutorial considering more complex ML scenarios to train Deep learning networks on encrypted data, with specialised _distributed_ settings for **remote analytics**.

## Get the material

Clone the current repository by running the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial.git
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `ppml-tutorial`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd ppml-tutorial
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location.
Bear with me for another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

## Installation Instructions

All the materials in this tutorial (code, and lecture notes) are made available as
Jupyter notebooks.

**(1)** There is no specific _hardware requirement_ to execute the code, i.e. running everything
on your laptop should be more than fine üòä.

**(2)**: As for the _software requirements_, we will be using a pretty standard Python/PyData stack:
`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for all the data science and Machine learning parts,
along with `pytorch` and `torchvision` to work on the Deep Learning examples.

Moreover, a few **extra** / specialised packages will be also featured:
- [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft): A platform for Remote Data Science
- [Opacus](https://opacus.ai): A library to train PyTorch models with differential privacy
- [PHE](https://pypi.org/project/phe/): A Python 3 library implementing the Paillier Partially Homomorphic Encryption

Please refer to the [`setup.md`](./setup.md) document for step-by-step instructions to set up the environment
on your computer.

If you spot any error/mistake, please feel free to reach out directly to [me](mailto:valerio@openmined.org?subject=PPML%20SciPy23%20Issue), or to open an [Issue](http://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial/issues)
on the repository.

Any feedback will be very much appreciated!

Thank you! üôè
