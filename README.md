# PPML: Machine Learning on Data you cannot see

Repository for the [tutorial](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/3TAPD8-1) on **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** (`PPML`) presented at [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/)

## Intro

Privacy guarantee is **the** most crucial requirement when it comes to analyse sensitive data.
However, data anonymisation techniques alone do not always provide complete privacy protection;
moreover Machine Learning models could also be exploited to _leak_ sensitive data when _attacked_,
and no counter-measure is applied.
*Privacy-preserving machine learning* (PPML) methods hold the promise to overcome all these issues,
allowing to train machine learning models with full privacy guarantees. In this tutorial we will explore
several methods for privacy-preserving data analysis, and how these techniques can be used to safely train
ML models _without_ actually seeing the data.

### Description

Privacy guarantees are **the** most crucial requirement when it comes to analyse sensitive data. These requirements could be sometimes very stringent, so that it becomes a real barrier for the entire pipeline. Reasons for this are manifold, and involve the fact that data could not be _shared_ nor moved from their silos of resident, let alone analysed in their _raw_ form. As a result, _data anonymisation techniques_ are sometimes used to generate a sanitised version of the original data. However, these techniques alone are not enough to guarantee that privacy will be completely preserved. Moreover, the _memoisation_ effect of Deep learning  models could be maliciously exploited to _attack_ the models, and _reconstruct_  sensitive information about samples used in training, even if these information were not originally provided. 

*Privacy-preserving machine learning* (PPML) methods hold the promise to overcome all those issues, allowing to train machine learning models with full privacy guarantees.

This workshop will be mainly organised in **three** main parts. In the first part, we will introduce the main concepts of **differential privacy**: what is it, and how this method differs from more classical _anonymisation_ techniques (e.g. `k-anonymity`).  In the second part, we will focus on Machine learning experiments. We will start by demonstrating how DL models could be exploited (i.e. _inference attack_ ) to reconstruct original data solely analysing models predictions; and then we will explore how **differential privacy** can help us protecting the privacy of our model, with _minimum disruption_ to the original pipeline. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial considering more complex ML scenarios to train Deep learning networks on encrypted data, with specialised _distributed federated_ _learning_ strategies.

Jupyter notebooks.

**(1)** There is no specific _hardware requirement_ to execute the code, i.e. running everything
on your laptop should be more than fine üòä.

**(2)**: As for the _software requirements_, we will be using a pretty standard Python/PyData stack:
`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for all the data science and Machine learning parts,
along with `pytorch` and `torchvision` to work on the Deep Learning examples.

Moreover, a few **extra** / specialised packages will be also featured:
- [Opacus](https://opacus.ai): A library to train PyTorch models with differential privacy
- [PHE](https://pypi.org/project/phe/): A Python 3 library implementing the Paillier Partially Homomorphic Encryption
- [Flower](https://flower.dev): A Federated Learning library for PyTorch


To get ready to run the code in this tutorial you could either (a) install and configure a (`conda`) environment
on your computer with all the necessary dependency; or (b) use [**Anaconda Notebooks**](https://nb.anaconda.cloud)
and run everything without installing anything at all on your computer.

Please refer to the [`setup.md`](./setup.md) document for step-by-step instructions, or to get a special
**discount code** to access Anaconda Notebooks.

If you spot any error/mistake, please feel free to reach out directly to [me](mailto:vmaggio@anaconda.com?subject=PPML%20SciPy23%20Issue), or to open an [Issue](http://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial/issues)
on the repository.

Any feedback will be very much appreciated!

Thank you! üôè
