## Abstract

Privacy guarantees are one of the most crucial requirements when it comes to analyse sensitive information. However, data anonymisation techniques alone do not always provide complete privacy protection; moreover Machine Learning (ML) models could also be exploited to _leak_ sensitive data when _attacked_ and no counter-measure is put in place.  

*Privacy-preserving machine learning* (PPML) methods hold the promise to overcome all those issues, allowing to train machine learning models with full privacy guarantees.

This workshop will be mainly organised in **two parts**. In the first part, we will explore one example of ML model exploitation (i.e. _inference attack_ ) to reconstruct original data from a trained model, and we will then see how **differential privacy** can help us protecting the privacy of our model, with _minimum disruption_ to the original pipeline. In the second part of the workshop, we will examine a more complicated ML scenario to train Deep learning networks on encrypted data, with specialised _distributed federated_ _learning_ strategies.

### Outline

- **Introduction**: Brief Intro to `PPML` and to the workshop ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/leriomaggio/ppml-jgi))

- **Part 1**: Strengthening Deep Neural Networks
    - Model vulnerabilities: 
        - Adversarial Examples and `FGSM` (_Fast Gradient Sign Method_) [notebook](1-fast-gradient-sign-method/FSGM Attack.ipynb)
        - Model _Inference attack_ notebooks: [training](2-mia-differential-privacy/1-MIA-Training.ipynb) | [reconstruction](2-mia-differential-privacy/2-MIA-Reconstruction.ipynb)
    - Deep Learning with Differential Privacy
        - Model _Inference attack_ with `OPACUS`  notebooks: [training](2-mia-differential-privacy/4-MIA-Training-OPACUS.ipynb) | [reconstruction](2-mia-differential-privacy/5-MIA-Reconstruction-OPACUS.ipynb)

    - DL training on (Homomorphically) Encrypted Data [notebook](./3-federated-learning/2-Homomorphic-Encryption.ipynb)
    - OpenMined and PrivateAI series [notebook](./3-federated-learning/3-OpenMined-private-AI-series.ipynb)

## Get the material

Clone the current repository by running the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial.git
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `ppml-tutorial`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd ppml-tutorial
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location. 
Bear with me for another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

### Set up your Environment

There are indeed two (possibly _three_) methods that you could use to execute the code in the notebooks.

The **recommended** method is to setup a new `ppml` Python environment on your local machine.

Please refer to the [`setup.md`](./setup.md) document for a step-by-step guide on how to set up the environment, and to check that all is working.

**Alternartively** you could rely on services such as [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the notebooks interactively, and without needing to install anything.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial/HEAD) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial/blob/main/index.ipynb)

However, these alternative solutions come with some **caveats and workarounds** that should be considered:

1. MyBinder does not support connection to remote hosts on (not-allowed) network ports. This means that all the examples in Sec. 3 running `syft` and `duet` will **never** work.
    - I would recommend running those notebooks in `Colab` in case.
2. To use Google Colab it is necessary to have a **Google Account**. Plus, the environment cannot be setup automatically so sometimes additional deps and packages should be installed first
    - On this note, please consider that notebooks requiring additional dependencies contain instructions to do so, in their preamble section.
