# PPML: Machine Learning on Data you cannot see

Repository for the [tutorial](https://2022.pycon.de/program/QHJ7SX/) on **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** (`PPML`) presented at [PyConDE 2022](https://2022.pycon.de/)

## Abstract

Privacy guarantees are one of the most crucial requirements when it comes to analyse sensitive information. However, data anonymisation techniques alone do not always provide complete privacy protection; moreover Machine Learning (ML) models could also be exploited to _leak_ sensitive data when _attacked_ and no counter-measure is put in place.  

*Privacy-preserving machine learning* (PPML) methods hold the promise to overcome all those issues, allowing to train machine learning models with full privacy guarantees.

This workshop will be mainly organised in **two parts**. In the first part, we will explore one example of ML model exploitation (i.e. _inference attack_ ) to reconstruct original data from a trained model, and we will then see how **differential privacy** can help us protecting the privacy of our model, with _minimum disruption_ to the original pipeline. In the second part of the workshop, we will examine a more complicated ML scenario to train Deep learning networks on encrypted data, with specialised _distributed federated_ _learning_ strategies. 

### Outline

- **Introduction**: Brief Intro to `PPML` and to the workshop ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/leriomaggio/ppml-pyconde))

- **Part 1**: Strengthening Deep Neural Networks
    - ML Model vulnerabilities: Adversarial Examples and _inference attack_
    - DL training with Differential Privacy

- **Part 2**: Primer on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
    - DL training on (Homomorphically) Encrypted Data
    - Federated Learning and Intro to Remote Data Science

_Note_: the material has been updated after the conference, to match the flow of the presentation as delivered during the conference, as well as to incorporate feedbacks received afterwards.

### Get the material

Clone the current repository, in order to get the course materials. To do so, once connected to your remote machine (via `SSH`), execute the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-pyconde.git
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `ppml-pyconde`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd ppml-pyconde
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location. Bear with me another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

### Updating your Environment

To execute the notebooks in this repository, it is necessary to set up the environment. 

Please refer to the [`Get-Ready.ipynb`](./Get-Ready.ipynb) notebook for a step-by-step guide on how to setup the environment, and check that all is working, and ready to go.

**Note**: You could run this notebook directly in [VSCode](https://vscode.dev), or in your existing Jupyter notebook/lab environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook Get-Ready.ipynb
```
